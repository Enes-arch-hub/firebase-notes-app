A simple and intuitive notes app that helps students store, organize, and access their notes efficiently. The app will also include features to track study sessions and provide insights into study habits to enhance academic performance.

## Implemented Features

    *   `@mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`: For UI components.
    *   `@mui/icons-material`: For icons.

2.  **Project Structure:**
    *   Create `src/pages` directory for different pages (e.g., `Home.jsx`, `Notes.jsx`, `About.jsx`).

3.  **Basic UI:**
    *   Implement a `Header` component with navigation links.
    *   Design a clean and modern UI using Material-UI components.

4.  **Routing:**
    *   Set up routes for Home, Notes, and About pages in `App.jsx`.

5.  **Notes Page:**
    *   Create a form to add new notes.

    *   Implement functionality to delete notes.
